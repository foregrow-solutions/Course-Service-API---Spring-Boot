                        <p>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations with respect to Entry-Level Driver Training
                            guidelines mandate that all those drivers who seek to obtain a Commercial Driver's License
                            after February 7, 2022, must complete the Entry-Level Driver Training program from a
                            certified training provider to be eligible to give their skills test to obtain their CDL.
                            The drivers on whom the ELDT regulations are applicable are themselves responsible to
                            complete this training, implying that the onus will be off the shoulders of motor carriers
                            who employ these drivers. Entry-Level Driver Training courses are designed to ensure higher
                            safety standards are practiced by drivers before they begin operating a commercial motor
                            vehicle on public roads. It is a compulsory federal standard of training curriculum which is
                            rationalized and rendered in CDL training by every leading CDL training school.</p>
